A systematic review18 focusing on the use of Vitex illustrated that in four out of five discrete placebo-controlled trials
and two comparator trials, Vitex was superior to placebo, pyridoxine and magnesium in the treatment of PMS. In
another study, it appeared comparable to fluoxetine for PMDD.16 The safety of Vitex is described as excellent, with
adverse effects being infrequent and mild.18,19 Studies have shown a dose dependent treatment response; however,
due to the variability in quality and content of preparations a dosage range to treat PMS cannot be recommended.
RCTs including St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) show conflicting results. A trial20 including
36 women with mild PMS showed significant improvements in physical and behavioural symptoms but no
improvement in mood or pain-related symptoms. Another trial21 including 125 women found no evidence Evidence

other medications, in particular it should not be used concurrently with SSRIs and can render low dose
