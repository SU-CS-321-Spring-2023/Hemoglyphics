Abstract
  Recently, the term premenstrual disorders (PMDs), which includes premenstrual syndrome and premen-
  strual dysphoric disorder as a continuum, has been proposed. Although the precise etiology of PMDs
  remains unknown, the involvement of hormonal ﬂuctuations is clear. The brain transmitters, serotonin
  and γ-amino butyric acid, also seem to be involved. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and oral contraceptives
  are the current mainstay of treatment, but these are insufﬁcient. Even the currently used prospective two-
  period symptom diary is not widely used in actual clinical practice, creating a major problem of discrep-
  ancy between research and clinical practice. In this review, I would like to outline the latest information
  and problems in the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of PMDs, with an emphasis on promising new
  therapies.
  Key words: allopregnolone, PMDD, PMDs, PMS, serotonin.

later, when hormone levels have stabilized.42 This fact
indicates the importance of hormonal ﬂuctuations in
the etiology of PMDs.
   As far as neurotransmitters are concerned, two
have been proposed to be involved in the pathology
of PMDs: serotonin and γ-amino butyric acid
(GABA).43 Serotonin is a well-known etiologic factor
in mood and anxiety disorders as well as PMS.44
Serotonin is activated by estrogen, so serotonin
levels are physiologically low before menstrua-
tion.45,46 With regard to serotonin reuptake inhibi-
tors (SSRI), which are antidepressants, the fact that
they are considered in the ﬁrst-line treatment for
PMS/PMDD supports the importance of serotonin
in the etiology of PMDs.4,33 Removal of tryptophan,
a precursor of serotonin, from the diet has been
reported to cause premenstrual symptoms, which
further suggests serotonin involvement in etiology.47
Neuro-imaging is a very advanced method in neuro-
