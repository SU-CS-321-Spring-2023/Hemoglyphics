Abstract
Premenstrual symptoms, including physical and mood symptoms, affect a large proportion of women worldwide. Data on
premenstrual symptoms across nations and age groups is limited. In the present study, we leveraged a large international
dataset to explore patterns in premenstrual symptom frequency with age. A survey was administered to users of the Flo
mobile application (app), aged 18 to 55. The survey queried app users about a range of premenstrual symptoms. Respondents
were asked whether they experienced each symptom every menstrual cycle, some cycles, or never. Age was also captured
and categorized as 18–27, 28–37, 38–47, 48–55. Data was summarized and Pearson’s chi square test for count data assessed
differences in symptom frequency by age group. A sample of 238,114 app users from 140 countries responded to the survey.
The most common symptoms reported were food cravings (85.28%), mood swings or anxiety (64.18%), and fatigue (57.3%).
Absentmindedness, low libido, sleep changes, gastrointestinal symptoms, weight gain, headaches, sweating or hot flashes,
fatigue, hair changes, rashes, and swelling were significantly more frequent with increasing age (p’s < 0.001). Mood swings
and anxiety did not vary by age group. Of the respondents, 28.61% reported that premenstrual symptoms interfered with
their everyday life each menstrual cycle. In a large international sample, the majority of women reported premenstrual food
cravings, mood changes, and fatigue every menstrual cycle. Mood symptoms did not vary by age group, suggesting that
premenstrual mood changes are a persistent issue among women of reproductive age.

premenstrually (Schoep et al. 2019). However, there is
limited data on the occurrence of premenstrual symptoms
across nations and by different age groups. Premenstrual
symptoms can be physical, such as fatigue, irritability,
bloating, or breast tenderness, or affective, such as irritability, anxiety, or mood lability, and occur on a continuum of severity (Angst et al. 2001; Borenstein et al.
2003, 2005). Premenstrual symptoms occur during the
late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (roughly the week
before menses onset), resolve within a few days of menstruation onset, and are absent in the postmenstrual week
(Epperson et al. 2012; Halbreich 2004). Premenstrual
syndrome (PMS) includes mild to moderate physical and/
or mood symptoms and occurs in roughly 20% of women,
while premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), at the
severe end of the continuum, includes more impairing
symptoms and is found in 3 to 8% of women (Epperson
et al. 2012; Halbreich et al. 2003; Wittchen et al. 2002;

Yang et al. 2008). Premenstrual symptomatology in both
PMS and PMDD is thought to be due to an abnormal
sensitivity to steroid hormones that fluctuate across the
menstrual cycle (Schmidt et al. 1998; Martinez et al.
2016; Hantsoo and Epperson 2020; Schweizer-Schubert
et al. 2021). For the purposes of this paper, we will refer
to the general term “premenstrual symptoms” when it
is not clear that symptoms meet criteria for either PMS
or PMDD, and only use the terms PMS or PMDD when
criteria are met.
Premenstrual symptoms may occur at any point
during the female reproductive years, from menarche
to menopause. PMS or PMDD may initiate in the
teen years (Rapkin and Mikacich 2013), but most
often initiate in a woman’s 20 s (Strine et al. 2005).
Premenstr ual symptoms may peak around age 35
(Dennerstein et al. 2011a; Tschudin et al. 2010),
although few studies have examined the prevalence
of premenstrual symptoms across age groups. A large
study of over 3500 women reported the prevalence
of moderate to severe mood-based PMS as 10.7% in
women aged 15–24, 8.6% in women aged 25–34, 11.2%
in women aged 35–44, and 10.8% in women aged 45–54
(Tschudin et al. 2010), suggesting that women in midlife were slightly more likely to experience moderate
to severe premenstrual mood symptoms than younger
or older groups. However, another cross-sectional
study found that premenstrual symptoms were less
common in women ages 36 to 44 years, compared
with younger women (Freeman et al. 1995). It is also
possible that certain symptoms worsen or improve
with age. For instance, some symptoms may worsen in
the mid-thirties (Dennerstein et al. 2011b) but improve
prior to the menopause transition (Dennerstein et al.
2011a), although longitudinal data is lacking. One goal
of the present study was to examine the frequency of
a range of premenstrual symptoms in those aged 18 to
55, accounting for a wide age range.
Premenstrual symptoms occur across cultures and
nationalities. In a meta-analysis assessing the prevalence
of PMS in twelve countries, the highest prevalence
was reported in Iran (98%) and the lowest prevalence
was reported in France (12%) (Direkvand-Moghadam
et al. 2014). European countries in general reported a
lower prevalence of PMS compared to Asian countries
included in the study. Reports of premenstrual symptom
severity also vary by country. Individuals in the UK,
Brazil, Japan, Korea, and Australia reported relatively
greater severity and duration of premenstrual symptoms,
while those in Hong Kong and Pakistan reported the
lowest severity and duration of symptoms (Dennerstein
et al. 2011b).

L. Hantsoo et al.

Finally, premenstrual symptoms may have a significant
impact on an individual’s daily functioning (Halbreich et al.
2003). In a study of over 4000 women from 19 different
countries, those with moderate to severe premenstrual
symptoms showed increased absenteeism and decreased
productivity at work (Heinemann et al. 2012). In a survey of
over 40,000 women, 38% were unable to perform activities
of daily life due to premenstrual symptoms (Schoep et al.
2019). Among adolescents, at least 20% reported PMS
symptoms associated with functional impairment (Rapkin
and Mikacich 2013). There is minimal evidence on how
functional impairment varies by country. One study
reported there was no decrease in work productivity in
Asian countries among those with PMS/PMDD, while all
other continents found work-related decreased productivity
in those with PMS/PMDD (Heinemann et al. 2012).
Another study assessing European and Latin American
countries found that impairment in function was most
severe in the home setting, followed by social, educational,
and work settings, which was consistent across both
continents (Dennerstein et al. 2010). Given the impairment
caused by premenstrual symptoms, assessing and properly
treating premenstrual symptoms is an important clinical
and public health issue.
The aims of the present study were to leverage a large
international dataset, collected via a mobile application
(app) Flo, to (1) explore prevalence of premenstrual
symptoms across ages ranging from 18 to 55 and (2)
explore prevalence of premenstrual symptoms by nation.

Materials and methods
a. Overview
This was a cross-sectional survey study of women aged 18 to
55. The survey was administered to users of the Flo Health
mobile app, a free app available on both the Android and
iOS platforms. The survey was administered from May 12,
2017 to June 23, 2020 using a chatbot dialogue. Participating women who answered the “Premenstrual Syndrome
(PMS) Survey” were included. The survey was released in
10 languages (English, Russian, Spanish, German, French,
Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Japanese, and Chinese) and was
available to all women using the Flo app. The geographical
location of the user was estimated based on the IP address.
All participants in the study agreed to the use of their deidentified and aggregated data for research purposes. Data
were deidentified and sent in aggregate to the Johns Hopkins research team. The Johns Hopkins Institutional Review
Board (IRB) reviewed the protocol and acknowledged the
application as a minimal risk secondary research protocol.

b. Survey

b. Frequency of premenstrual symptoms

Survey questions addressed a range of physical and cognitive-affective premenstrual symptoms. These included
mood swings or anxiety; absentmindedness; sleep changes;
headaches; hot flashes or sweating; fatigue; breast soreness,
swelling, or hypersensitivity; constipation or diarrhea; food
craving; weight gain; increased appetite; swelling; abdominal spasms; low libido; changes in hair; or skin rashes. Participants were also asked if premenstrual symptoms interfered with their daily life. For each item, participants could
respond “Yes, every cycle,” “Yes, but not every cycle,”
“No,” or “Prefer not to answer.” Specific questions are listed
in the supplementary Online Resource 1.

Across the sample of 238,114 users, the most common
symptom that participants reported experiencing every
cycle was food cravings (85.28%), followed by mood
swings or anxiety (64.18%) and fatigue (57.3%) (Table 1).
All other symptoms were experienced by fewer than 50% of
the responders. Among respondents, 28.61% reported that
premenstrual symptoms interfered with their everyday life
each cycle, and an additional 34.84% reported that premenstrual symptoms interfered with their everyday life some
cycles. Percentages are based on number of participants that
responded to an individual question, which may be fewer
than the total sample n; frequency of all symptoms across
the full sample is shown in Fig. 1.

c. Statistical analyses
Summary data was available by age group within the
sample; individual level data was not available due to
international data privacy guidelines. Data was examined
descriptively by country. To examine age effects, data was
categorized into four age groups: 18–27, 28–37, 38–47, and
48–55 years old. Pearson’s chi-squared test for count data
with independent samples was conducted to test differences
in symptom frequency by age group, considering the frequency of the response “Yes, every cycle” for each item. A
significant omnibus chi-square test statistic indicated a group
difference in the symptom by age. The specific age strata
where symptoms were more or less prevalent than in the
total sample were probed by post hoc evaluation of residuals. Post hoc tests were based on adjusted Pearson residuals
that measured the difference between observed and expected
cell counts, with observed difference from expected inferred
from Bonferroni-adjusted p values to account for multiple
comparisons. Post hoc p values tested the deviation from
the expected prevalence in the total sample in a specific age
group, with the null assumption that prevalence in each age
group was equal to prevalence in the total sample. R and R
Studio were used to conduct analyses (R Core Team 2020).

Results
a. Participant characteristics
Data was obtained from mobile app users across 140 countries. Only countries with at least 500 respondents were
included. This resulted in data from n = 238,114 unique
users who contributed data to these analyses. This sample
included 162,390 (68.14%) in the 18–27 years age group;
61,210 (25.69%) in the 28–37 years age group; 13,684
(5.74%) in the 38–47 years age group, and 1026 (0.43%) in
the 48–55 years age group.

c. Frequency of premenstrual symptoms by age
group
We examined the frequency of symptoms in each age
group (Table 1). Symptom frequency was significantly
greater than expected with increasing age for most symptoms. That is, symptoms were more common in the older
age groups than expected if symptoms were equivalent by age. These included absentmindedness (X2 (3,
N = 211,577) = 864.3, p < 0.0001), low libido (X 2 (3,
N = 213,000) = 2877.8, p < 0.0001), sleep changes (X2 (3,
N = 210,880) = 611.92, p < 0.0001), gastrointestinal symptoms (X2 (3, N = 221,667) = 631.53, p < 0.0001), weight
gain (X2 (3, N = 229,850) = 5783.4, p < 0.0001), headaches
(X2 (3, N = 215,342) = 321.44, p < 0.0001), sweating or hot
flashes (X2 (3, N = 214,158) = 316.49, p < 0.0001), fatigue
(X2 (3, N = 218,169) = 1640.3, p < 0.0001), hair changes
(X2 (3, N = 219,114) = 292.41, p < 0.0001), rashes (X2 (3,
N = 220,470) = 2839.2, p < 0.0001), and swelling (X2 (3,
N = 223,213) = 3812, p < 0.0001). In particular, these symptoms were less frequent than expected in the 18–27-year-old
age group and more frequent than expected in the 28–37-,
38–47-, and 48–55-year-old age groups.
Frequency of abdominal spasms was significantly lower
than expected as age increased (X2 (3, N = 231,705) = 98.503,
p < 0.0001). Specifically, abdominal spasms were more frequent than expected in the 18–27-year-old age group and
less frequent than expected in the 28–37-, 38–47-, and
48–55-year-old age groups.
Other symptoms were less frequent than expected in the
18–27 age group, more frequent than expected in the 28–37
and 38–47 age groups, and not significantly different than
expected for the 48–55 age group. These symptoms were
food cravings (X2 (3, N = 228,383) = 267.63, p < 0.0001),
breast sensations (X2 (3, N = 216,633) = 314.17, p < 0.0001),
and increased appetite (X 2 (3, N = 225,718) = 836.23,
p < 0.0001).

Mood swings and anxiety did not differ significantly
by age group (X2 (3, N = 209,556) = 5.2119, p = 0.1569).

d. Frequency of premenstrual symptoms by country
We examined rates of premenstrual mood and anxiety
symptoms among the 140 countries (Fig. 2). Premenstrual mood symptoms reported every cycle were most
common in Egypt (70.82%), Lebanon (67.42%), and
Brazil (66.60%) and least common in Mali (27.64%),
Gabon (26.02%), and Togo (25.99%). Participants across
nations also reported that premenstrual symptoms caused
interference in their functioning every cycle (Fig. 3). Participants reported interference most frequently in Egypt
(68.59%), Pakistan (61.53%), and Brazil (64.73%) and
least frequently in Nigeria (40.65%), Gabon (33.84%),
and Congo (35.17%).

907

Discussion and conclusions
Within a large international sample of 238,114 adults experiencing menstrual cycles, the majority reported experiencing
premenstrual food cravings, mood swings or anxiety, and
fatigue. Furthermore, while physical symptoms tended to
increase with age, mood swings and anxiety were reported
at similar frequencies across age groups.
Our results were similar to that of Schoep and colleagues,
who in 2019 published a study on the premenstrual symptoms among 42,879 women in the Netherlands (Schoep et al.
2019). Schoep et al. found that the most common premenstrual symptoms were dysmenorrhea (~ 85%), psychological complaints (77%), and tiredness (71%) (Schoep et al.
2019). In our study, psychological complaints (64.18%)
and tiredness or fatigue (57.3%) were also among the most
common symptoms, although less frequent than in Schoep
et al.’s study. Also, we found food cravings (85.28%), not
dysmenorrhea, to be the most commonly reported symptom.
Together, our results align with those of Schoep et al. to

suggest that premenstrual psychological complaints are a
key symptom experienced by individuals worldwide. This is
important information for clinicians in primary care, gynecology, or mental health settings who work with individuals
experiencing menstrual cycles. Clinicians should be aware
that food cravings, mood symptoms, and fatigue are common premenstrually, and that premenstrual mood symptoms
may occur across age ranges while physical symptoms may
be more common in older menstruators. This is particularly
important when evaluating individuals for mental health
concerns, as premenstrual mood symptoms may be mistaken
for other types of mood disorders and vice versa.
Participants in our sample also reported significant
interference with daily activities due to their premenstrual
symptoms. Among respondents who reported on interference, 63% reported that premenstrual symptoms interfered
with their everyday life either every cycle or some cycles.
The 28.61% who reported that premenstrual symptoms interfered with functioning every cycle was similar to the results
of Schoep et al., who found that 38.4% of women reported
interference with function during their period. This is critical, as women with PMS report reduced productivity and
more missed days at work as well as increased frequency of
healthcare utilization (Borenstein et al. 2003).
Regarding changes in symptoms with age, we found that
symptom frequency increased with age for absentmindedness, low libido, sleep changes, gastrointestinal symptoms,
weight gain, headaches, sweating or hot flashes, fatigue, hair
changes, and swelling. Conversely, frequency of abdominal spasms decreased with age. Findings on worsening of
premenstrual symptoms with age have been mixed. Some
studies suggest that premenstrual symptoms lessen with age
(Freeman et al. 1995, 2004; Silva et al. 2008; Sternfeld et al.
2002). For instance, a cross-sectional study found that premenstrual symptoms improved with age, with women ages
36 to 44 being less symptomatic than those 20 to 35 years
old (Freeman et al. 1995). However, other cross-sectional
data on PMS symptoms in women between 15 and 54 years
of age found that women aged 35 to 44 had the greatest
symptom severity relative to other age groups (Tschudin
et al. 2010). Other studies suggest that certain symptoms
worsen with age, particularly somatic symptoms (Sylvén
et al. 2013). Another study found an inverted U-shaped relationship between symptom severity and age, with premenstrual syndrome severity peaking at middle age (Dennerstein
et al. 2011b). Some data report that the relationship between
PMS and age vary depending on the particular symptom
(Dennerstein et al. 2011a). In that study, the symptoms demonstrating an inverted U-shaped severity curve with the peak
at 35 years of age included both physical (skin disorders,
fatigue, appetite changes, body aches, abdominal bloating,
swelling of extremities, breast tenderness, weight gain) and
affective (anger, depressed mood, irritability). However, in

13

L. Hantsoo et al.

that study, confusion, mood swings, and abdominal cramps
decreased with age, and other symptoms had no relationship with age. Longitudinal research is needed to more fully
characterize which premenstrual symptoms may worsen, or
improve, over time.
In the current sample, many of the symptoms that
increased with age are associated with perimenopause, such
as hot flashes, absentmindedness, and low libido. Thus, it
makes sense that these premenstrual symptoms increased
with age, potentially as women were approaching menopause, given that the sample included women up to age
55. The mean age of menopause (final menstrual period) is
51 years in the USA (Menopause - Symptoms and causes.
2021). Our finding that abdominal spasms decreased with
age is similar to findings by Dennerstein and colleagues, in
which abdominal cramps decreased with age (Dennerstein
et al. 2011a).
Intriguingly, mood swings and anxiety did not differ significantly by age group. Indeed, across age groups, 61–64%
of respondents reported mood or anxiety symptoms every
menstrual cycle. This represents the majority of participants
in this international sample across age ranges, suggesting
that premenstrual mood symptoms are a key public health
issue globally. Some studies suggest that premenstrual mood
symptoms are less common among women ages 45 years
and older (Strine et al. 2005), or lessen with age (Freeman
et al. 1995, 2004; Silva et al. 2008; Sternfeld et al. 2002).
However, in the present sample, our data suggests that premenstrual mood symptoms are a common, persistent complaint across age ranges. This high prevalence is important
information for clinicians, as some may be unaware of the
commonness of premenstrual mood complaints, leaving
premenstrual mood symptoms underrecognized and undertreated (Hantsoo et al. 2022).
Finally, the prevalence of mood swings and anxiety symptoms varied widely between countries. Premenstrual mood
and anxiety symptoms were most common in Egypt, Lebanon, Brazil, Iran, and Jordan, with 64% or more participants
reporting premenstrual affective symptoms every menstrual
cycle. Premenstrual affective symptoms were least common
in Cameroon, Congo, Mali, Gabon, and Togo, with fewer
than 28% of participants reporting monthly mood changes.
This is similar to a meta-analysis that found wide variation
in prevalence of PMS across twelve nations, ranging from
12% (France) to 98% (Iran) (Direkvand-Moghadam et al.
2014). We also found wide variation in percentage of participants reporting that premenstrual symptoms affected their
functioning, from 35.17 to 68.59%. This is novel, as there
is little evidence to date on how functional impairment varies by country. One study reported less impact of premenstrual symptoms on work productivity in Asian countries
compared to non-Asian countries (Heinemann et al. 2012),
while another found that impairment was similar between

European and Latin American countries (Dennerstein et al.
2010). As we did not query about specific impacts of premenstrual symptoms on functioning (e.g., missed days of
work), but asked more broadly, “Do PMS symptoms interfere with your everyday life?” this may have produced the
broad range of results, as respondents may have interpreted
the question of interference differently.
In sum, a majority of participants in this large international sample reported premenstrual food cravings, fatigue,
and mood changes, with the frequency of physical symptoms increasing with age and mood symptoms occurring
uniformly across age groups. Although additional research is
needed before this information can be implemented in clinical settings, our data does suggest that premenstrual symptoms are common, and clinicians should be aware of this. In
addition, longitudinal research is required to understand how
premenstrual physical and mood symptoms progress across
the lifetime, including reproductive transitions such as the
postpartum or perimenopause.
This study’s main strength was its large, international
sample encompassing women across a range of geographic
areas and ages. There were also several limitations. One
limitation of the study is that it was based on aggregated,
pooled data due to international mobile app data privacy
rules, i.e., individual level data was not available. This
prevented us from examining potential health or demographic mediators, such as parity or hormonal contraceptive use, on reported premenstrual symptoms. The use of
aggregated data also prevented us from examining whether
premenstrual symptoms may have been affected by medication use (e.g., antidepressants) or medical or psychiatric
comorbidities. Furthermore, the data format precluded us
from statistically testing for differences in premenstrual
symptoms between countries. The data were collected from
users of a mobile app, meaning that all participants needed
access to a mobile telephone, as well as wireless internet
or cellular internet access, which may have selected for a
well-resourced sample. Another important limitation was
that the data was self-report and was not based on clinician
rating or validated scales designed specifically to measure
premenstrual symptoms in a clinical sample. Thus, it is
possible that participants over-reported or under-reported
premenstrual symptoms. Indeed, this study was designed to
examine the presence of premenstrual symptoms, not their
severity. Relatedly, it is possible that participants interpreted
the question of symptom interference differently between
respondents, as described above. Other studies have used
more objective measures of premenstrual symptom interference, such as days missed from work (Halbreich et al. 2003;
Yang et al. 2008; Heinemann et al. 2012; Dennerstein et al.
2010). There is also the possibility of reporting bias — it
may be that individuals who are more aware of premenstrual symptoms are more likely to use a mobile app to track

909

symptoms, or are more likely to respond to a survey about
premenstrual symptoms.
In summary, we found that in a large international sample,
premenstrual mood symptoms were common and occurred
at similar frequencies across age groups. In contrast, physical premenstrual symptoms tended to increase with age.
Finally, we found that a significant proportion of women
reported that premenstrual symptoms interfered with daily
functioning every cycle in the overall sample but that this
proportion varied widely by country, indicating a need for
further study.
