     ABSTRACT
     Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a health problem that occurs with physical and psychological symptoms presenting about five days before
     menstruation, end within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The most common symptoms are appetite changes, edema, breast
     tenderness, abdominal pain, back pain, headache, fatigue, insomnia, depressive affect, irritability, angry outbursts andanxiety. Most women’s
     half of lifes go through with premenstrual problems and quality of life is affected negatively. PMS prevalence is notably high in the world and
     in our country. In this respect, it is important to increase awareness of health professionals and women about PMS. The aim of this review is
     to explain current approaches of PMS management in the context of international guidelines. Getting detailed anamnesis for the diagnosis
     of PMS, if necessary, consultations and laboratory investigations are carried out. In addition, the diagnosis of PMS is confirmed by assessing
     women’s symptom records for at least two months showing the type of symptoms and the time of appearance of these symptoms in the menstrual
     cycle. PMS management is carried out gradually by multidisciplinary team that adopted an integrative holistic approach in the direction of
     individualized plan. The first step includes creating awareness about PMS, teaching to women self-screening, lifestyle changes, regulation of diet,
     methods of coping with stress. In the second step, cognitive behavioral therapy and complementary alternative therapies are implemented. If the
     problem continues, there is pharmacological treatment in the third step. Finally, surgical treatment is applied in the fourth step.
